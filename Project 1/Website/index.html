        <br>
        <br>
        My experiences have allowed me to witness firsthand the transformative power of technology within industrial contexts. 
        Beyond my expertise in chemical processes, I am deeply passionate about harnessing the potential of IT systems and automation to optimize efficiency, enhance precision, and elevate overall operational performance. 
        This passion has led me to consistently seek out opportunities to bridge the gap between traditional engineering practices and the dynamic realm of digitalization.
